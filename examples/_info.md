# How to use?

It is very simple to use **examples**. Just choose which example to compile and do,

For Clang,
```bash
clang++ example_function.cpp [example_to_compile] -o [object name]  -I../include
```

For GCC/G++,
```bash
g++ example_function.cpp [example_to_compile] -o [object name]  -I../include
```

## Why add example_function.cpp
It is crucial to add because many example uses it for demonstration.
