    * Games and Graphics
* **Easy to Integrate:** Designed with developer experience in mind, MPA offers a clean and intuitive API for seamless integration into your ARM projects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and use MPA, you will need:

* An ARM-compatible toolchain (e.g., GCC for ARM, Clang)
* Make (or your preferred build system)

### Building MPA

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mystic-devloper/MPA-Mystic-Precision-Arm.git
    cd MPA-Mystic-Precision-Arm
    ```
2.  **Build the library:**
    This library generally comes pre-build but if you want to build use,
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will compile the library and generate the necessary artifacts (e.g., `libmpa.a`).
